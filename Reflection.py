Does my language shape how I think?
Well yes to a certain degree it does. However it is important to note that our
thinking as people is complex and truly systemic. Hence, there are several
interconnected factors that contribute to shape how we think. Our language is
only a fraction of it. Some of these factors include, religion, exposure,
beliefs, culture, all dogmas, parents and society, financial standing and reading.
The language of space, is language that is used to describe space. When I started
reading this I thought space, azin outer space, the planets and all.
Our languages influence how we interact with the world. As the article suggests,
certain geographical languages have us paying much keener attention to detail
more than others. "Everyday communication in a geographic language provides the
most intense imaginable drilling in geographic orientation.", says the author.
4 paragraphs: 
a.What surprised you most in reading the excerpt?


b.>>>What is your primary native language (besides English?)
My mother tongue is Kiswahili. It is Kenya's National language and is spoken
widely in Eastern Africa.
 >>>Does your primary language have any significant differences from English?
Yes, there are certain words in English that do not exist in kiswahili. However,
in the recent years experts of the swahili language have added words to fit the
ever changing and evolving world. 
>>>Any similarities to Guugu Yimithirr? Explain.
Not at all. The compass directions and perceptions of space used in English
happen to be very similar to those used in my native language. However this
understanding I have may be influenced by the fact that I grew learning both English
and swahili, hence kept translating them from one language to another.

c.>>>Have there been moments in which you felt that your primary language or
another language you speak "got in the way" of something you wanted to express?
That is, have you run into the limitations of language in the manner suggested by
the excerpt? Elaborate.
I have had many experiences where Kiswahili got in the way of a conversation or
an interaction with people from other countries. Often because of direct translation
to english the meaning, detail, sensitivity or urgency of a message changes and is lost
I recently discovered that I am a language enthusiast and more so of African Language.
This interest has strengthened my relationship with friends from Rwanda, Zimbabwe,
Nigeria and Ghana. Nonetheless, I realised that the more I learned the more I
saw the differences between people and how they think. To a certain degree the language
you speak also shapes how agressive, submissive or out going you become. Rwandans
are more laid back, and calm and so is their language. Ghanaians on the other hand,
speak a language that is demostrative and warm so they happen to be very
outgoing.
One thing to note is that these languages are not linear in effect to human thinking
and behaviour. In contrast they are interconnected and affect each other.
d.Discuss to what extent you think artificial languages (such as Python) have
the ability to shape human thought, if at all. Or, do you think artificial
languages are fundamentally different from human ones, such as Guugu Yimithirr
or English? Elaborate.
I do think artificial or formal languages, have rules and boundaries with which
programmers have to stay within. While I understand that this is important for
predicting desired outcomes, the consequence is that as a programmer my creativity
may be limited. I may be forced to think within a box and not have the opportunity
to expressed wild, daring imaginations. Artificial languages are fundamentally
different from natural languages not heavily
influenced by human behaviour in comparison to natural languages, this may mean
that the interconnection present between artifical language and people, will be strictly
linear. What does that mean in relation to human thought? It means that our thinking
can and easily be influenced by these very languages.
Our brains are very categorical, so if you feed it information that is within a certain
boundary it will only always respond to that farmiliar information.

e.Are there parts of the Python language that feel foreign to you, despite
knowing what the word means in English? 
So far many of the parts used in python describe what exactly they mean. I am yet
to encounter a part that doesnt but as soon as I do, I will take note of it.

The more I interact with python the complexity I once thought it had becomes simpler
and easier to understand. One striking difference python has from english,
is that python has a completely different structure that can be daunting at first.

I can be able to figure out what x represents because I have learnt about variable
names used in python and now I understand that letters such as x can be used to name
and store different types of values.


Is there supposed to be any danger when using nested loops
